# Latest Update Log

**Version**: `v1.1.0`
**Date**: 2025-12-28
**Status**: Stable

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. Codebase Refactoring & "Clean Code"
- **Memory Optimization**: The `Collector` now returns pointers to `RawStats` structs instead of copying values by value. This reduces memory pressure and allocation overhead during every collection tick.
- **Engine Logic**: `Evaluate` function split into specialized helpers (`checkCPU`, `checkRAM`, etc.) for better readability and maintainability.
- **Categorization**: Introduced explicit `Category` enums in `CheckResult`. The output layer no longer relies on fragile string parsing to determine which section a metric belongs to.

### 2. Architecture Visualization
- Added a MermaidJS Diagram in `docs/architecture/diagram.md` illustrating the reactive data flow between the Collector, Engine, and TUI.

### 3. TUI Rendering
- **Native Rendering**: The `Console` view was refactored to use native `lipgloss` rendering instead of capturing `fmt.Fprint` output into a buffer. This ensures consistent styling and better performance.
- **Pointer Receivers**: The Bubble Tea `MainModel` now uses pointer receivers consistently, ensuring state mutations are handled correctly without unnecessary copying.

### 4. Configuration
- **Dynamic Config**: Hardcoded thresholds in the engine have been replaced with a flexible `Config` struct.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed `Init` method missing from `MainModel` which caused `tea.Model` interface implementation errors.
- Added missing `.gitignore` to prevent tracking binary artifacts.
